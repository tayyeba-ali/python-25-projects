# Connect Four - Python Project

This is a Python implementation of the classic **Connect Four** game, based on a tutorial by **Keith Galli**. The game features a graphical interface built using `pygame` and logic powered by `numpy`, `math`, and `sys` modules.

## ðŸŽ® Features

* Two-player gameplay
* Graphical game board using `pygame`
* Real-time disc dropping animation
* Win detection and game-over screen

## ðŸ“š Technologies Used

* `numpy`
* `pygame`
* `math`
* `sys`

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed along with the required libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pygame
```

### Running the Game

1. Clone the repository or download the `.py` file.
2. Run the Python file:

```bash
python connect_four.py
```

3. Enjoy the game with a friend!

## ðŸ“Œ Gameplay Rules

* Players take turns dropping colored discs into a 7-column, 6-row grid.
* The first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four discs wins.
* If the board is filled without any player winning, the game ends in a draw.

## ðŸ“º Tutorial Reference

## ðŸ§  Learning Outcome

This project is ideal for those who:

* Have a good grasp of Python basics
* Want to learn game development using `pygame`
* Wish to understand array manipulations using `numpy`
