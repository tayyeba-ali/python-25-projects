# 🕹️ Tic-Tac-Toe (Python)

This is a simple **Tic-Tac-Toe game** implemented in Python for two players.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 2-player gameplay (Player X and Player O)
* Players choose a position between 1 and 9 to make a move
* The game board is displayed after every move
* The game ends when a player wins or there's a tie

## 🧠 Logic

The game checks for a winner after every move by checking horizontal, vertical, and diagonal conditions. If the board is full and no player has won, the game ends in a tie.
