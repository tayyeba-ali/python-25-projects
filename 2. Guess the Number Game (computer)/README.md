# 🎲 Guess the Number Game (User vs Computer)

This is a simple Python game where the **user tries to guess a random number** chosen by the computer within a specified range.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The goal is to guess the number the computer randomly picked between 1 and a maximum value you specify.

---

## 💻 How It Works

* The computer randomly generates a number between 1 and `x` (e.g., 10).
* The user keeps guessing until the correct number is guessed.
* Feedback is provided if the guess is too low or too high.
* The game ends with a congratulatory message when the user guesses correctly.

---

## 📜 Example Output

```
Guess the number between 1 and 10: 5
Sorry, guess again. Too high.
Guess the number between 1 and 10: 3
Sorry, guess again. Too low.
Guess the number between 1 and 10: 4
Yay, Congratulations! You have guessed the number 4 correctly.
```

## 🧠 Learning Points

* Using the `random` module
* Working with loops and conditionals
* Accepting and validating user input

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Save the code as `guess_number.py`
2. Open a terminal or command prompt
3. Run the script:
